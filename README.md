Finally beginning to code and put code out there.

These are just simple shell script commands that I have created to make my life easier while nivigating the cli.

As my journey progresses with shell script, I will look to resolve some things I just don't know how to do yet and add functions native to cli and that just come naturally.

I hope it helps those viewing it! Enjoy!!
